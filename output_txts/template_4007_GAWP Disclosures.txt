## **Customer Responsibility** 


It is important that all of the information provided by you or on your behalf or on behalf of an assured person, is complete and accurate. Should this not be so, the possible consequences of incomplete, misrepresented or nondisclosed information associated with your application include the cancellation of the products applied for and the forfeiture of any monies paid to date, the repudiation of all claims irrespective of their cause or nature, and the possible institution of criminal action against you.

 Whilst reasonable steps would have been taken to ensure that the products applied for by yourself are suitable for providing cover appropriate to the purchase you have made, no analysis of your financial needs or risk profile has or will be undertaken, and no advice has been given by the Insurer or those associated with it. It is therefore vital that you take particular care to ensure that the product or products you have purchased are appropriate and adequate for your needs.

## **Treating customers fairly policy** 


DuePoint has a strong focus on customer satisfaction and aims to be respected and recognised for the fair treatment of its customers. DuePoint is fully committed to delivering service of the highest standard as its customers are its most valuable asset. DuePoints Treating the Customer Fairly (TCF) policy is structured according to the guidelines provided by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) to ensure it consistently delivers fair outcomes to its customers. 


## **Approach to service delivery** 


The Financial Services Board has outlined six key themes, which are central to the TCF initiative. DuePoint will comply with and contribute to these 6 TCF fairness outcomes viewed from the perspective of its customers as follows: 


1Customers are confident that they are dealing with a provider where the fair treatment of customers is central to its culture 


2Products and services marketed and purchased in the retail market are designed to meet the needs of identified customer groups and are targeted accordingly 


3Customers are given clear information and are kept appropriately informed before, during and after the time of contracting 


4Where customers receive advice, the advice is suitable and takes account of his/her circumstances 


5Customers are provided with products that perform as providers have led them to expect, and the associated service is both of an acceptable standard and what they have been led to expect 


6Customers do not face unreasonable postsale barriers to change products, submit a claim or make a complaint 


## **Standards of service delivery** 


DuePoint aims to demonstrate through its behaviours and monitoring that it is consistently treating customers fairly throughout the stages of the product life cycle to which it can contribute. In order to achieve these service standards DuePoint and its employee members undertake to: 


Ensure that customers are provided with clear, concise information and kept appropriately informed before, during and after the purchase of his/her products allowing them to make informed decisions 


Ensure that regular, clear and appropriate correspondence is maintained with customers at all times and that the relevant communication protocols are strictly followed 


Adhere to DuePoints phone etiquette standards and to provide excellent service to the customer where the fair treatment of the customer is central to that service 


Follow the principle that customer service at all stages must meet customer expectations and that any promises or commitments made must be met 


NOT give any financial advice to customers 


Ensure that any request from a customer is attended to without any unnecessary barriers or delays 


Fairly manage the customers expectation at all times 


Leave the customer feeling pleased about his/her experience with DuePoint and confident that he/she is dealing with an honest, professional and ethical organisation where the fair treatment of clients is central to the companys culture 


Ensure all third parties contracted with are committed to treating DuePoints customers fairly. 


## **Conflict of Interest** 


DuePoint strives towards ensuring it is able to appropriately and effectively identify and manage potential conflicts. It may manage potential conflicts through avoidance, establishing confidentiality barriers and by providing appropriate disclosure of the conflict to affected clients.

 In determining whether there is or may be a conflict of interest to which the policy applies, DuePoint considers whether there is a material risk of damage to the client, taking into account whether DuePoint or a DuePoint representative, associate or employee: 


is likely to make a financial gain, or avoid a financial loss, at the expense of the client 


has an interest in the outcome of a service provided to the client or of a transaction carried out on behalf of the client, which is distinct from the clients interest in that outcome 


has a financial or other incentive to favour the interest of another client, group of clients or any other third party over the interests of the client 


receives or will receive from a person other than the client, an inducement in relation to a service provided to the client in the form of monies, goods or services, other than the legislated commission or reasonable fee for that service. 


DuePoints policy defines possible conflicts of interest as, *inter alias*: 


conflicts of interest between DuePoint and the client 


conflicts of interest between our clients if we are acting for different clients and the different interests conflict materially 


conflicts of interest where associates, product suppliers, distribution channels or any other third party is involved in the rendering of a financial service to a customer 


Once a conflict of interest has been identified it needs to be appropriately and adequately managed. DuePoints TCF Compliance Officer will assess each conflict, including whether the conflict is actual or perceived, what the value of the conflict or exposure is and the potential reputational risk. The TCF Compliance Officer together with management will then agree on the controls that need to be put in place to manage the conflict.
The TCF Compliance Officer together with management will find the appropriate form to disclose the conflict of interest to the client, by delivering written communication to the relevant client, bringing the conflict of interest to the clients attention and disclosing any financial interests to its representatives.
No conflicts of interest exist at the time of printing this document.
